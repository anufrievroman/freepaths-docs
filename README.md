# FreePATHS

This Monte Carlo algorithm simulates trajectories of phonons in 3D models of nanostructures, which consists of a box with holes or pillars of various shapes. The algorithm outputs phonon trajectories, heat fluxes, temperature maps and profiles, the thermal conductivity, scattering maps and statistics and other information.
