# Nanowire

The example `examples/nanowire.py` shows thermal transport simulation in a simple nanowire at room temperature. Here is an example of phonon paths in such a structure showing mostly diffusive behavior:

The algorithm calculates the thermal profiles, heat flux, and the thermal conductivity at different time intervals. From the profile plots, we can see how the temperature and heat flux profiles converge after about 6th timeframe, as the system is reaching the state:

This can be used to estimate the [thermal conductivity](../advanced-tutorials/themal-conductivity-calculation.md) of the structure. The  plot of thermal conductivity shows us the convergence and the averaging:

For a simple nanowire, the material and effective thermal conductivities are identical and equal to about 54 W/mÂ·K, which is consistent with experimental observations.
